InputStreamReader Problem 1: Convert Byte Stream to Character Stream Using InputStreamReader
Problem:
Write a program that uses InputStreamReader to read binary data from a file and print it as characters. The file contains data encoded in a specific charset (e.g., UTF-8).
Approach:
Create a FileInputStream object to read the binary data from the file.
Wrap the FileInputStream in an InputStreamReader to convert the byte stream into a character stream.
Use a BufferedReader to read characters efficiently from the InputStreamReader.
Read the file line by line and print the characters to the console.
Handle any encoding exceptions as needed.
